      <p>Lion Rex's have what is a called a <code>double maned coat.</code> Which is the mane that is around their neck and can also be on their rear end.</p>
      <p>Due to the nature of the Lion Rex's fur, it is important to practice regular grooming. They also require more frequent grooming because of their manes.</p>
      <p> Brushing them weekly can help keep the fur soft and prevent any mats or tangles. Always brush in the direction that the fur grows in.</p>
      <p>Using a comb on the mane can be more effect and help break up any early mats or tangles that may appear in the mane.If the mane begins getting unruly trimming it can make your Lion Rex much more comfortable.</p> 
      <p>Regualr nail trimming is also important to maintain a happy and healthy rabbit. If trimming their nails isn't something you're comfortable with doing, seek out a rabbit vet or groomer in your area.</p>
      <p>Rabbits are generally very clean animals and should rarely require human intervention in regards to bathing.</p>

    <p>Caring for your Lion Rex can come off as a daunting task. In reality, caring for any rabbit would fall in between the care required for cats and dogs. Meaning, they aren't as independant as a cat might be, but they also aren't as needy as a dog may be.</p>
    <p>Some requirements for caring for your Lion Rex include: 
      <ul class="caring">
        <li>A diet consisting of about <code>80% hay.</code>The other 20% should be a combination of leafy greens such as romaine lettuce, and pellets. </li>
        <li>Fruits or anything sweet should only be given as special treats.</li>
        <li><code>Constant access to water</code> is also important.</li>
        <li>Access to a <code>litterbox.</code> Rabbits can be potty trained which makes clean up easier.</li>
        <li>You can put a constant supply of hay in the literbox to promote and teach the habit of using it. Rabbits usually like to eat while they poop!</li>
        <li>They should have ample room to play. You should not keep your rabbit locked in a cage 24/7. They need rooom to exercise and stretch those legs.</li>
        <li>If you allow your rabbit to roam your house during play time, keep an eye out to make sure they arent nibbling anything they shouldn't be (ex. wires).</li>
        <li>Providing them with enrichment can be a good way to promote healthy chewing and allow them to widdle their teeth.</li>
